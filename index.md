    Why does IT interest me?
    </h2>
  <p>I am interested in IT as I enjoy problem solving and have thoroughly enjoyed 
    programming/ coding which I completed in a previous degree. I was undertaking 
    an engineering degree previously and I found myself enjoying the programming 
    elements of the course while not seeing a future for myself in engineering, 
    this started my interest in undertaking the IT course and to attempt to work 
    my way to a programming role. I currently work in a system support role for a 
    media company, but have no further experience besides that.</p>
  <p>I chose to come to RMIT as the option to study via correspondence was very 
    flexible and the university has a great reputation, especially in the IT field. 
    Because I work full time it is important for me to have the flexibility to study 
    when time permits it and this course allows that.</p>
  <p>During the degree I expect to gain proficiency in a variety of different 
    programming languages and systems, and to ready myself for the workforce.</p>
